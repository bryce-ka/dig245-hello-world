<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>Bryce Anthony, Senior- Computer Science Major</h2>

<body>
  <h4>Why am I taking this course?</h4>
  <p>I wanted to take this courese because I want to learn about softeware development and developing websites. Although I've taken a class on manifest
    on multimedia design before, I thought it would be cool to focus on web design</p>

  <h4>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</h4>
  <P>I've actually built a web app. This taught me alot about how the internet and webbsites work but also gave me some
    experience building webpages using bootstrap, html, and css. As a computer science major, I have plenty of programming
    experience, Although I enjoy programming in R, C, and python; I also have experience using Java, Julia, SASS, and STATA. </P>

  <h4>What are your goals in this course?</h4>
  <p>My main goal for this course is just to feel more comfortable building webpages using css and html but also to learn alot more about the software development
    process as a whole. I know i have alot to learn about HTML and CSS but I barely understand and am really excited about learning Javascript!</p>
  <h4>Files and naming conventions</h4>
  <p>One of the learn computing activities I completed was File organization and naming conventions, which taught me alot about digital naming conventions and why
    naming conventions are important.I learned to use descriptive names that you would be able to understand in the future when naming files and to also use version
    numbers and dates when saving different versions of files. The activity also taught me not to use spaces and to be attentive to capitalization when naming files.
    Another importnat consideration when building projects and establishing your file structure is to structure the files in a meaningful way that does more than just
    storing the files in the same place. Then naming conventions you use should also vary based on the language youre programming in. The standard naming convention for
    Python and R are both snake_case while Javascript and CSS use camelCase.</p>

  <h4>Git Version Control</h4>

  <h4>Why am I taking this course?</h4>
  <p>I wanted to take this courese because I want to learn about softeware development and developing websites. Although I've taken a class on manifest
    on multimedia design before, I thought it would be cool to focus on web design</p>

  <h4>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</h4>
  <P>I've actually built a web app. This taught me alot about how the internet and webbsites work but also gave me some
    experience building webpages using bootstrap, html, and css. As a computer science major, I have plenty of programming
    experience, Although I enjoy programming in R, C, and python; I also have experience using Java, Julia, SASS, and STATA. </P>

  <h4>What are your goals in this course?</h4>
  <p>My main goal for this course is just to feel more comfortable building webpages using css and html but also to learn alot more about the software development
    process as a whole. I know i have alot to learn about HTML and CSS but I barely understand and am really excited about learning Javascript!</p>
  <h4>Files and naming conventions</h4>
  <p>One of the learn computing activities I completed was File organization and naming conventions, which taught me alot about digital naming conventions and why
    naming conventions are important.I learned to use descriptive names that you would be able to understand in the future when naming files and to also use version
    numbers and dates when saving different versions of files. The activity also taught me not to use spaces and to be attentive to capitalization when naming files.
    Another importnat consideration when building projects and establishing your file structure is to structure the files in a meaningful way that does more than just
    storing the files in the same place. Then naming conventions you use should also vary based on the language youre programming in. The standard naming convention for
    Python and R are both snake_case while Javascript and CSS use camelCase.</p>

  <h4>The Command Line</h4>
  <p>Another Learn Computing activity I completed was the command line. This tutorial taught me what the command line is and how to navigate my computers filesystem using the
     terminal/command line. I leaned that OS stands for operating system, CLI stands for command line interface, that bash stands for bourne again shell, and that programs ending
     in ".sh" are shell programs that can program and run cripts using the terminal. In addition to the terminology used when talking about the terminal, the activity also defined
     terms for actions in the terminal. For example, the command pwd prints the working directory of the terminal which is essentially the file path that the terminal is currenly
     on and the command whoami will return the the username of the person acessing the terminal. On my computer the whoami command returns "bryce" but it would return different
     things on others computers.</p>

  I absolutely LOVE this concept and by extension the website. To me it's a brand that started as a joke/meme and has turned into a believable conspiracy theory.
  The ideaology of the birds arent real movement is that the birds we now have around us arent real, but that they're government drones which have been slowly
  replacing real birds since the 1970's. The birds arent real team made really entertaining content to continue to spread their message.

This website was kinda scary and reminded me of the stanley parable video game. Click Click Click is a website with
a big green button that you click! Clicking the buttons triggers a narrator and comments that line the side about your
screen about your clicks, mouse movements, and other interactions with your web browser. I liked how it used the information
it was recieving from your browser to make "comments" that kinda freak you out.

<h5><a href = "https://www.geoguessr.com/" target = "_blank"></a></h5>
<p>
This is a website that hosts a game called Geoguessr. Geoguessr is a game that has you guess your location in the world after dropping you in a random
location with googles street view. Once the location has been guessed you get a score based on how far away you were from the actual location on the map.
I personally njoy the concept and thought it was a really cool way to use google maps which i feel like doesnt really get used that much outside of navigation.
